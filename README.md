# Accident Data Analysis and Filtering using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and filtering accident data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from accident datasets, identify patterns, and apply filtering techniques to preprocess data for better model performance.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization and statistical analysis of accident trends.
- **Filtering Techniques:** Outlier detection and anomaly removal.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Applying classification and clustering models.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score analysis.

## Dataset
The project uses publicly available accident datasets, such as those from:
- Kaggle
- Government transportation departments
- Open-source road safety databases

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/accident-data-analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd accident-data-analysis
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Run the preprocessing script:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. Perform exploratory data analysis:
   ```bash
   python eda.py
   ```
3. Train the machine learning models:
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
4. Evaluate the model performance:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

## Machine Learning Models Used
- **Logistic Regression** (for binary classification)
- **Random Forest** (for multi-class classification)
- **K-Means Clustering** (for unsupervised learning)
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** (for classification tasks)

## Results
The project evaluates models based on:
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score
